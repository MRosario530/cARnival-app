# AnimELLE Crossing: cARnival

## What is AnimELLE Crossing: cARnival?

AnimELLE Crossing: cARnival is a mobile application developed in Unity to support a set of Augmented Reality language learning games. This app contained 3 different games, each focusing on different aspects of language learning (audio, text, and imagery) and was the first ELLE game to implement adaptive learning algorithms to the questions.

## What are the features of AnimELLE Crossing: cARnival?

AnimELLE Crossing: cARnival did more than simply allow for the user to log into their ELLE account and play one of three games - it took advantage of the existing APIs from previous ELLE semesters to enable a combination of features not present in any singular game or application. This includes:

- The ability to sign in and out of your ELLE account.
- Being able to play 3 different AR language learning games in one application.
- Earnable cosmetics that stay attached to your account.
- A statistics screen which shows you your performances on all modules, not just those you played in the cARnival.
- Adaptive Learning so that the application adjusts to present you questions and terms you struggle with more.

## Where can I see this?

AnimELLE Crossing: cARnival is currently being tested for a release on the Google Playstore in the near future! If this comes to fruition, you may see the application on iOS at a later date. In the meantime, check this video out to see what the app looks like:
